## How to identify if a problem requires DP

1. DP is recursive, so same way you determine if problem is recursive
   1. Recursion vs DP:
      1. DP problems always give you a choice (e.g. whether we want this item in our knapsack or not)
         - Two recursive calls, probability of DP
      2. Problem asks for optimal (minimum, maximum, largest, max value, max profit)
2. Problem asks for something optimal

## Approach

Recursive solution --> Memoization --> Tabulation

DP has 10 parent problems

1. 0-1 Knapsack (6 variations - subset sum, count number of subset sum, target sum)
2. Unbounded Knapsack (5)
3. Fibonacci (7)
4. Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) (15)
5. Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) (10)
6. Kadane's Algorithm (6)
7. Matrix Chain Multiplication (7)
8. DP on trees (4)
9. DP on grid (14)
10. Others (5)
